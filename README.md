# Serial Communication using the ATmega328p microcontroller

This is a project that aims to perform asynchronous serial communication between 2 devices (Arduino) through software, without using the features already available ready for this type of communication in the ATmega 328p. To represent such functionality, 2 Arduinos were used, a master, which receives the data typed by the user on a keypad, handles the data, sends the processed data through serial communication to a second Arduino, which receives the information sent, it performs the data processing again and then shows the entered values on the LCD display.

Note: Project developed in Architecture and Programming of Microcontrolled Systems classes
